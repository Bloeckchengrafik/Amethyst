This file is stored in the `Metadata Cache` folder within `%appdata%/amethyst` and it's a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file containing
the metadata of a given audio file, the filename is gonna be the same same as the name of the audio file it stores metadata for

eg. `enjoii - Never Say Goodbye.flac` => `enjoii - Never Say Goodbye.flac.amf`


## Regeneration
These files are generated when Amethyst analyzes a file for metadata, they can be rewritten by forcefully refreshing metadata
within Amethyst from the dropdown menu or with the shortcut `CTRL + ALT + R`

## Deletion
As mentioned above to delete all metadata caching you can go to `%appdata%/amethyst/Metadata Cache` and delete all the files within the folder
