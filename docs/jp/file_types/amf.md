# Amethyst Metadata File (.amf)

This file is stored in the `Metadata Cache` folder within `%appdata%/amethyst` and it's a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file containing
the metadata of the given audio file. The filename is going to be the same as the name of the audio file it stores metadata for.
If the file is renamed amethyst will have to re-cache the metadata, meaning there may be copies of cached files.

eg. `enjoii - Never Say Goodbye.flac` => `enjoii - Never Say Goodbye.flac.amf`


## Regeneration
These files are generated when Amethyst analyzes a file for metadata. They can be rewritten by forcefully refreshing metadata
within Amethyst from the dropdown menu or with the shortcut `CTRL + ALT + R`.

## Deletion
As mentioned above, all metadata caches are stored in `%appdata%/Amethyst/Metadata Cache`. Simply deleting the files within the folder will achieve cache deletion.
