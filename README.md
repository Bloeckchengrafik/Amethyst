# üíé Amethyst 
Amethyst is an [Electron-based](https://electronjs.org/) audio player with a [node-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_graph_architecture) [audio routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal_flow) system, the main goal of this project is to make a [music player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_player_software) in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to see how far we can stretch language today to prove it's possible to provide pro-level features as most [DAWs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) / [DAEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_editing_software), while also providing useful tools and customizability to the [end-user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user) to deal with audio.
